== Motivation ==

I implemented this program while waiting for my jobs to complete on the super-computer.


== Graphical interface ==

Operations:

- Start or stop the time

- Reset the view

- View or hide vertices
- View or  hide edges

- Increase or decrease attraction
- Increase or decrease repulsion

- Toggle the type between 'linear', 'star' and 'random'
- Increase or decrease the number of vertices
- Increase or decrease the degree

- Increase or decrease the vertex radius
- Increase or decrease the edge length

- Add or remove a vertex
- Add or remove a edge



== Algorithms ==

It uses Coulomb's law for repulsion 

and 

Hooke's law for attraction.


== How to create a github page ===

godzilla ] git branch -a
